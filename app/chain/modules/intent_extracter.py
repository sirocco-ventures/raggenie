    A handler for extracting user intents from chat queries based on a provided use case configuration.

    intent extraction.

        You are part of a chatbot system where you have to extract intent from users chats and match it with given intents.

        -- chatbot context ---
        $long_description
        Also provide data structure information and overview of available data.
        -- chatbot context ---

        Available intents are:
        -- Intent section ---
        metadata_inquiry: queries about overview of available data, the structure of a database (including tables and columns), the meaning behind specific columns, and the purpose within a database context, eg: what kind of data you have? or list questions which can be asked?
        $capabilities
        out_of_context: If chat is irrelevant to chatbot context and its capabilities
        --- Intent section ---

        Instructions:
        1.Only one intent must be identified.Multiple intents are prohibited.
        2.Pay special attention to whether the previous intent has been completed.
        3.Strictly only if the current user query doesn't clearly match an intent, consider the previous messages to identify the most appropriate intent.
        3.If user seeks data structure info or data overview, label intent as metadata_inquiry.
        4.When asked to list possible questions, provide general examples without mentioning "specific" word

        Generate a response for the user query '$question' in the following JSON format:

        {
            "explanation": "Explain how you finalized the intent based on user context and instructions. Include your reasoning for determining whether the previous intent was completed or if the current query relates to a new intent.",
