            - use LIKE operator with LOWER function for string comparison or equality
            - Always use alias/table name for fields in WHERE condition
            - Do not use non existing tables or fields
            - id columns are mandatory for all operations
            - Do not use JSON_BUILD_OBJECT operation
            - Do not use unwanted joins
            - Do not return incomplete queries
